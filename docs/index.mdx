</Steps>

## Which AI Model Should I Use?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="For Chat Mode">
    **Any model works great**, including local LLMs.

    - **Ollama** or **LM Studio** — Free, runs locally, great for quick questions
    - **Gemini Flash** — Fast and affordable
    - **Claude or GPT-4** — Best quality responses

    Chat Mode just needs to understand the page and answer questions—local models handle this well.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="For Agent Mode">
    **Use Claude Opus 4.5 for best results.**

    | Model | Speed | Quality |
    |-------|-------|---------|
    | Claude Opus 4.5 | Slower | Best |
    | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Medium | Great |
    | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Fast | Good |
    | Gemini Flash | Fast | Good |

    <Warning>
    Local LLMs are not yet powerful enough for Agent Mode. The model needs strong reasoning to click the right elements and handle multi-step tasks.
    </Warning>
